abstract = {Sculpting is an art form that relies on both the visual and tactile senses. A faithful simulation of sculpting, therefore, requires interactive, physically accurate haptic and visual feedback. We present an interactive physics-based sculpting framework with faithful haptic feedback. We enable cutting of the material by designing a stable, remeshing-free cutting algorithm called Improved stable eXtended Finite Element Method. We present a simulation framework to enable stable visual and haptic feedback at interactive rates. We evaluate the performance of our framework quantitatively and quantitatively through an extensive user study.},
